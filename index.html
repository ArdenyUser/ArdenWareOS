<h1>Arden Ware OS (Thorium)</h1>
<h4>Simple non-gui OS.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Arden Ware OS brought to you by Ardeny Foundation employee Avery Stafford and built off of <a href="https://github.com/wichtounet/thor-os">Thor OS.</a> This project is under development. Please compile via <a href="https://github.com/wichtounet/thor-os#thor-operating-system">wichtounet's tutorial</a> to compile Thor OS. Kernal is&nbsp;<em>about&nbsp;</em>the same as Thors. Very similar to Thor currently. Expect updates until on the page we say there are none. Please run with <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU.</a></p>
